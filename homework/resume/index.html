<h1>Priscilla Ignacio</h1>
<h2>GIA Graduate Gemologist & Jewelry Designer</h2>

<p>Designer formed in advertisement in São Paulo with expertise in product design in Milan, Priscilla Ignacio, as a jewelry consumer, felt the need to find in the Brazilian Fashion market differentiated and original pieces that were made with high quality material and finishing touches.</p>
 
<p>Created with distinct techniques, varying depending on shape, design and function, several of the pieces are one-of-a-kind as well as the raw rocks, which these pieces contain. Matchless, just like the one who is wearing them. The brand doesn’t only offer beauty and exclusivity in its designs, but also durability and comfort.</p>
